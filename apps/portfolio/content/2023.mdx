### Getting into 2023


Entered into **2023** with a bang. My friend and I finished a long roadtrip of *5500mi* from New Jersey to New Mexico and back. Way too many memories and way too many risks taken,
and this is the start of the most eventful year till date. 

The updates about this will soon be put out.
