I've always had a negative impression towards consulting firms and I tried my best to not join them. My aversion towards consulting firms , though baseless, was pretty strong that I thought we don't work on one thing. We would be pushed as per manager's thought of us putting our efforts somewhere else. We would never be caring for a product completely. I've worked hard to get a job at a product startup which did music distribution for independent music artists. My life was absolute beauty, I had loads to learn and utilized almost every opportunity to apply what I'd learned. My aversion towards consulting firms somehow strengthened as I could do so much at a product startup and so did my love towards product companies. I was earning pretty less, but now familial pressures, to get married, had put me towards choosing another company. I was still adamant on choosing product startups, so I found one. Salary was too good to be true, and they did pay that much for a year. And then, layoffs. 80% of the company was laid off. I'm on a visa here, and I had to find a job in 60 days. I couldn't. Skill issues? Probably. This blog is not about my skill issues, hold off that horse for now. 

### Enter Consulting Firms

I moved back to my home country, and I got married. My wife and her family were supportive of me when I didn't have a job. I wasn't adamant on product anymore, I didn't have enough responsibilities earlier to prioritize something else over mine. Now I do, and I had find ways to get back the US since my wife is a student there. 

I finally found a job that paid pretty good, but wouldn't send me to the US for another 2 years. I didn't join them. I found another one that would send me as soon as possible, as I already have my work visa. My family thought that company was a godsend. And now I've joined a type of company that I've always avoided.

### First impressions

It's not as bad as I thought. People are nice. I can definitely see a difference, though it's not in my face. The difference is that your peers don't care about why they're making something. I always hear "that's how it was done" or "the manager didn't approve". Whose fault is it that the engineers are responsible for any improvement in the usage of certain things? For example, when it comes to using routes to switch between tabs versus handling tab panels client-side, I feel like routes are a better way. It avoids a lot of clicking and reduces the steps, which is better for customer service.

The manager is supportive of my views in some respects. In others, they provided proper reasoning for why they oppose my view. It's a proper dialogue between a manager and an engineer. Apparently, very few people come across this type of manager at a consulting firm.

### Conclusions

My beliefs about consulting firms have improved, but I still need to verify if the change is valid.

A consulting firm could be a new experience in my career, and definitely not a step in the wrong direction. It seems to offer valuable lessons in having a dialogue with clients, managing their expectations, and curbing my hunger to build solutions.

After all, this is what tech entrepreneurship looks like, right?

More impressions will come after a few more months.
