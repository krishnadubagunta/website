### Designing & Case study of photography image management and distribution portal

&nbsp;

#### Problem statement

In the scope of my experience as an amateur landscape photographer, there's a consistent desire to make my photos more visible online. 
My main places for sharing are Instagram and Twitter, where I hope to attract attention for my pictures.

However, I've come across an issue recently. It's not easy for me to put my pictures on all the websites I want to, whenever I want to. 
So, I'm considering creating something that can help with this. But before I start, there are some important things that this app needs to do.

First, it has to be good at handling my pictures and getting the image metadata and EXIF from them. This info includes the name of the picture, 
a shorter name for certain places, a description in a special way, and words that describe what's in the picture. After getting this info, the app needs to keep it safe.

Then comes the next part: actually putting the picture and its info on different websites. This means sending the picture and details to the places 
where I want to share them. By working on these challenges, the Karma app aims to make it easier for folks like me to share our pictures with more people.

#### Explaining the first part of the workflow

The diagram above displays the process wherein a user uploads a photograph. However, the real magic lies in what happens thereafter.

As a photographer, I want to avoid the complexities of manually converting my images by installing different plugins into my development workflow. My preference is for an 
alternative system to handle this task on my behalf. The objective is to attain images of impeccable qualityâ€”100% for my **Shopify** store, 80% for **Instagram**, 
and a dual 20% and 80% quality scheme for my **website**, among others.

Once my images are prepared for distribution, the status changes, enabling me to distribute them across all connected platforms.

I abruptly stop the process here, and pick it up when I figure out how to design this system ..... until then, thanks for reading.
