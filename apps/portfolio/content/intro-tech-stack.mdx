## How to introduce a new tech stack at a consulting firm?

&nbsp;

*Disclaimer: This post is not for anyone who's not working at a consulting company. I haven't been here long (only a couple months), so if my observations are wrong, it could very well be wrong.* 

As a consultant involved in client projects, opportunities to introduce new technologies can be quite limited. Challenges may arise from client resistance to certain technologies, the need for your consulting firm to train staff on new tech stacks (a common hurdle), or time constraints that prevent learning and implementing new technologies within the project timeline. Internally, there are often few projects where new tech stacks can be introduced and proposed to clients. Moreover, specialists in emerging technologies might not be prevalent within the firm, as their work might not be directly billable.

&nbsp;

### So, You Can&apos;t Introduce New Tech Stacks to a Project?...

You can. While introducing new tech stacks to ongoing projects is challenging due to bureaucratic hurdles, it is not impossible. As an engineering consultant, convincing various stakeholders is crucial and requires patience. The layers of approval include your peers, lead, direct manager, delivery head, onsite manager, and onsite engineering manager.

> ðŸ’¡ Don&apos;t get intimidated, you live long enough, you see yourself as one of the upperclassmen.

&nbsp;

To effectively advocate for new technologies, consider the following strategies and prepare a compelling presentation.

&nbsp;

#### Groom your teammates on your skills

It&apos;s essential that your team recognizes your skills to engage in meaningful discussions. Demonstrate your abilities without overshadowing others, and be receptive to their feedback. Your teammates may not be familiar with your expertise, especially if you&apos;re new to the team. Invest time in showcasing your skills to build credibility and foster collaboration

&nbsp;

#### Groom your management on your skills

This is something new I tried at this firm, and the people I know haven&apos;t done it here. I learned this from my friend, who&apos;s also in a consulting firm and has been almost an evangelist for consulting to me. He&apos;s one of the reasons I considered going into consulting, but enough about him.

I set up 1:1 meetings with my lead and delivery head to understand how they manage the team(s). I also talked about my work experiences and got to know them personally, so they understand where I come from and what my skills are.

They manage hundreds of people, or they have known hundreds of people. You might be one among them, or you might stand on top, but unless you take time to talk to them, they won&apos;t know you. They&apos;re the best resource for you as a engineering consultant to navigate in this ocean. You need to **groom your management on your skills**.

&nbsp;

#### Lead your team

When the opportunity arises, take charge of your team and guide them with your expertise. Effective leadership requires making well-informed decisions and presenting them thoughtfully to your lead. While this responsibility is significant, demonstrating your capabilities will earn you the respect and trust of your team.

Seek advice from your delivery head or manager on leadership strategies. They can offer valuable mentorship and support. By effectively leading your team, you&apos;ll build rapport with management and contribute to project success.

&nbsp;

#### Know your tech stack

Before proposing a new tech stack, thoroughly understand its implications. Be prepared to justify your choice by comparing it with conventional technologies. Evaluate the pros and cons, deployment strategies, and the readiness of your DevOps team. Your ability to master your tech stack will help you make a convincing case for its adoption.

Choosing a tech stack should not be based on personal preference alone. Ensure it aligns with the project&apos;s needs and offers tangible benefits.

&nbsp;

#### Exercise Patience

Avoid suggesting a new technology like NextJS for a simple client-side application just because of its advanced features. While exciting, it may not be necessary for basic projects. Focus on advocating for sophisticated frameworks when dealing with more complex projects. Exercise patience and wait for the right opportunity to make your case.

&nbsp;

#### Advocate for Your Tech Stack

Once you&apos;ve done your groundwork, prepare for a strategic presentation to gain management approval for your tech stack. Gather support from leads and delivery heads, and present your findings, overheads, and trade-offs. Emphasize the benefits to the client while highlighting how the new technology enhances your portfolio and professional growth.

By doing so, you also contribute to your peers' development and broaden the team's expertise.

&nbsp;

### Conclusion

Remember the effort it took to advance from school to college and then to earn your degree. Those achievements are not just accolades but milestones of perseverance. The same principle applies to introducing new tech stacks in consulting. Build your network, prove your value, and your insights will be recognized and valued.
