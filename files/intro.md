### Introduction
---
I'm a *full stack developer* with strong experience in object oriented programming focusing on DevX and UX. I have more than 4 years of experience in developing software for a music distribution company, managing multiple product lines, from design to launch as a dev responsible party.

Besides being a techie, I do landscape photography on the side, with a dash of product photography. Not like I've done many, but I have ideas to implement and do some shoots.

My photography takes me to various places, makes me live in lot of habitats. I camp or sleep in a car or stay in a hostel to energize myself for a hike.
